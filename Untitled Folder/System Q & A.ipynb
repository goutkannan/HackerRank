    "**1.  What is HTTP ? **\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP is a application layer protocol which is usually built on top of TCP/IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP is a stateless protocol. A stateless protocol does not require the HTTP server to retain information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when you enter a URL in your browser, this actually sends an HTTP command to the Web server directing it to fetch and transmit the requested Web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.  What are HTTP request methods ? **\n",
    "\n",
    "These request methods are usually called verbs to indicate the desired action to be performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Methods        | Description            \n",
    "| -------------- |-------------         \n",
    "| GET      |It is used to retrieve data and must not have any other side effects.          \n",
    "| POST       |Requests the server to accept the data enclosed. Used to update an existing entity.              \n",
    "| PUT  |It is either used to create a new resource or update an existing resource with the enclosed data.             \n",
    "| HEAD |Simillar to GET but it is used to request only response headers. \n",
    "| TRACE | Echoes the received request so that a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediate servers.\n",
    "| OPTIONS | Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified URL.\n",
    "| CONNECT |Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, usually to facilitate SSL-encrypted communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted [HTTP proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_proxy). \n",
    "| PATCH   |It is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.\n",

    "**4.  What is HTTP Proxy and how it works ? **\n",
    "A HTTP proxy speaks the HTTP protocol, it's especially made for HTTP connections but can be abused for other protocols as well (which is kinda standard already)\n",
    "\n",
    "The browser (CLIENT) sends something like \"GET http://host.tld/path HTTP/1.1\" to the PROXY\n",
    "and the PROXY will then forward the request to the SERVER. The SERVER will only see the PROXY as connection and answer to the PROXY just like to a CLIENT.\n",
    "The PROXY receives the response and forwards it back to the CLIENT.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a transparent process and nearly like directly communicating with a server.\n",
    "There are some additional heads that can be sent, proxies sometimes change/add stuff.\n",
    "Some proxies for example include your real IP in a special HTTP HEADER which can be logged on server-side, or intercepted in their scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIENT <---> PROXY <---> SERVER\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the client talks only to the proxy and not to server directly, this can be used to improve the security measures. \n",
    "\n",
    "**5. What is SMTP and given an example of email delivery ** \n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is an application that runs over TCP, it is used mail to deliver emails to the mail servers. It is a connection oriented and text based protocol, in which the client communicate with the server by sending sequence of string commands. \n",
    "SMTP uses ports like 25, 587 etc to send mails. \n",
    "\n",
    "A typical SMTP transaction consists of 3 command n reply sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. MAIL - Init command to establish return channel, bounce address etc. \n",
    ">ACK/NAK\n",
    "2. RCPT - Command to register receiver's address. One RCPT command for every recipient. \n",
    ">ACK/NAK\n",
    "3. BODY - Content of the email . \n",
    ">ACK/NAK\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a email: \n",
    "From Sender@gmail.com \n",
    "To   Receiver1@live.com, Receiver2@yahoo.com\n",
    "Body \"TEST EMAIL\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The sender's SMTP agent( url: \"mail.google.com\") communicates to smtp service at gmail say smtp.gmail.com to establish \"MAIL\" transaction. They the agent uses RCPT command with Receiver1@live.com first and Receiver2@yahoo.com second. On ACK it sends the body of the mail. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the SMTP service checks if the domian name of the recipient is internal(gmail itself) or external. Now, SMTP server will make DNS lookup the recipient's domian name and get the address if legit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the IP address, SMTP server forwards the email to it. Now the smtpservice@live.com take this emial and finds the recipient id and sends the mail to his mailbox. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using SMTP the mail can be delivered to only one machine. To over come this, POP3/IMAP4 protocol is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "AGENT --***SMTP***---> SMTP Server ---***POP3/IMAP***--> Receiver \n",
    "\n",
